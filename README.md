# InterDimenEmbed

# code2vec is implemented using https://github.com/dcoimbra/dx2021
Our replicated version is in code2vec folder

given dataset, ReportCC++Code2Vec.ipynb file generates the embeddings

cosine similarity and rankings are generated using ReportCC++Code2VecOurs.ipynb file

the result after applying the rankings are availabe inside classifier folder. There is a folder named 'data'. The data folder contains the ranking results in single dimension, double dimension and hybrid dimension(VulSim). you can use those data to feed into the decisionTree.ipynb classifier inside classifier folder and get the result directly.
